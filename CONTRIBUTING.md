# üë∑ Contributing to mon.icu

mon.icu is an open project and we appreciate any willing to help! You can help
us by submitting a link shortcut which we will deploy to mon.icu as soon as we
approve it. Fear not, we're open to any proposals as long as they're about MAS,
DDLC or Friends of Monika~

## üôã How do suggest something?

You can [create a pull request][1] with an edit of file [_redirects][2] that
will include changes you want us to introduce. Please, only suggest one URL
shortcut per proposal!

Or alternatively, you can [open an issue][3] with your ideas. We'll be sure to
review them and implement as soon as we're able to!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to keep in mind?

Please keep in mind that all links you suggest will be reviewed and checked. We
will not accept links to:
* Any sort of shocking or disturbing content
* Any content that isn't MAS, DDLC or FoM related
* Content you are not allowed to share publicly (such as 'ask for a link'
links)
* Links that are routed through IP grabbers and alike services
