# Compatibility section: previously these shortcuts were in use, so we retain
# them in order not to break links. Back then they were not sorted anyhow.
# Please do not try to 'optimize' this section and set aliases; these URLs
# are preserved as is intentionally, do not assign these paths to aliases
# even if they are bitwise identical copies.
